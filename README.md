# BasicJDBC
Simple JDBC code, connecting to DB and executing all basic commands

This project represents a simple java database connection with all the basic SQL commands in it.
I have used the SOLID principles as best I can. The code is clean and easy to follow, because of the individual classes.
Every class has only one job to execute, which makes the project easy to build on top of it.

I have added and a text file with all the commands, as well as information on objects, interfaces and others that may lead to some questions!
Happy programming journy to all of you!
