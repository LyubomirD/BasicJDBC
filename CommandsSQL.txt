Main, basic commands in SQL

1. Main functions
SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE

Note: no need to write in uppercase, but is easy to differentiate between SQL and other

2. Most important commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

3. SELECT command
syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;
SELECT * FROM table;
* - select all fields, columns

+ SELECT DISTINCT
statement is used to return only distinct (different) values
syntax: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table;

4. INSERT INTO command
syntax: INSERT INTO table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
INSERT INTO table VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

Note: when inserting values close them around with ''
Example: ... VALUES ('SomeonesName', 'Age', ...);

5. UPDATE
syntax: UPDATE table SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 ... WHERE condition;
UPDATE table SET column1 = value1;

6. DELETE command
syntax: DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table;

!NOTE: WHERE
clause is used to filter records/ fulfill a specified condition

WHERE + UPDATE
specifies which record to update, if omitted will update all records in the table with the same input record

WHERE + DELETE
specifies which record to delete, if omitted will delete all record in the table

7. Connection
- interface
- to establish connection with database for the java application
- provides methods for transaction like:
commit(), rollback(), setAutoCommit(), setTransactionIsolation()...

8. Statement and PreparedStatement difference
8.1 Statement
- base interface
- cannot accept parameters
- when we use static SQL
- when running only one SQL query is ideal

Used for:
- CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements
Performance:
- low
- cannot read/ write binary data

8.2 PreparedStatement
- interface
- accepts input parameters
- want to use SQL multiple times

Used for:
- queries that are executed multiple times
Performance:
- better than Statement
- can read/ write binary data

9. What is a "static SQL"
- it is called static because the SQL statements in the program are static
(they do not change each time the program is run)

10. DatabaseMetaData
- interface
Note: data about data is known as metadata
- provides methods to get inf. about the DB you connected with
Example: DB name, DB version, column max ...
